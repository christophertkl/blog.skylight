# Hello there

I am a Mathematics educator, but because what a beloved instructor in NIE said in class, above all I teach students.

Also an aspiring programmer and avid reader. I discovered an interest in programming during an introductory course to Python in the first year of my undergraduate studies. From there, I have dabbled briefly in deep learning and web development to limited results.

I should note here that any opinions or materials posted here is solely my own, and should not be interpreted as representative of any organisation or community I participate in.

## What is this site about?
This is where I post some thoughts regarding technology, productivity, education and (very occasionally) mathematics. It is for the sake of sparking discussion and sharing what I think would be useful for someone out there. I imagine this to be a letter to people encountering similarities as I had, to offer some light on their journey.

Ultimately, this website is a 'bullet' ([Fire bullets, not cannonballs](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/fire-bullets-then-cannonballs.html)), by management master [Jim Collins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Collins) in the pursuit of writing.

<p>Skillshare is a learning platform for online classes, most of which are available through subscription. The classes have topics ranging from the arts such as graphic design and filmmaker, entrepreneurship and lifestyle.</p>

<p>I have about two weeks of protected time, where I choose to spend it upgrading myself. I chanced upon Skillshare on the recommendation of some of my favourite YouTubers.</p>

<h2 id="about-taking-online-courses">About taking online courses</h2>

<p>Starting on this journey, I am not quite certain to the efficacy of taking courses online. Doing online courses via Udemy is something I have done to limited effect, in order to upgrade my programming skills. I have also spent a fair amount of time on Coursera (attending the excellent MOOC <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn</a>) and Khan Academy (which saved my Linear Algebra course grade in NUS, but these significant changes were limited in number.</p>

<p>Many of the decisions we make would be effortless if we know the outcome beforehand, so I am writing for anyone encountering the same decision point.</p>

<p>Whatever that is learnt needs application on a project. We only internalise the learning after we have applied the ideas to create something.</p>

<p>These series of posts would then be the application, where I summarise the key ideas of the courses I have taken. As a disclaimer, I have not receiving any sponsorship from Skillshare or any of the creators I share lessons about.</p>

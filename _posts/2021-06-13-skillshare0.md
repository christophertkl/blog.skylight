*This post is part 5 of a series of posts, discussing some lessons in my 3-week long exploration of Skillshare courses. The summary of the lessons learnt can be found [here](https://christophertkl.github.io/blog.skylight/learning/meta/2021/06/25/skillshare_reflection.html).*

## About Skillshare and why I am bringing it up

Skillshare is a learning platform for online classes, most of which are available through subscription. The classes have topics ranging from the arts such as graphic design and filmmaker, entrepreneurship and lifestyle.

I have about two weeks of protected time, where I choose to spend it upgrading myself. I chanced upon Skillshare on the recommendation of some of my favourite YouTubers.

## About taking online courses

Starting on this journey, I am not quite certain to the efficacy of taking courses online. Doing online courses via Udemy is something I have done to limited effect, in order to upgrade my programming skills. I have also spent a fair amount of time on Coursera (attending the excellent MOOC [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)) and Khan Academy (which saved my Linear Algebra course grade in NUS, but these significant changes were limited in number.

Many of the decisions we make would be effortless if we know the outcome beforehand, so I am writing for anyone encountering the same decision point.

Whatever that is learnt needs application on a project. We only internalise the learning after we have applied the ideas to create something.

## What this post is about

These series of posts would then be the application, where I summarise the key ideas of the courses I have taken. As a disclaimer, I have not receiving any sponsorship from Skillshare or any of the creators I share lessons about.

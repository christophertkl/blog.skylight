title: 'Maximise the reward-to-effort ratio'
---

I was too lazy to work for an A in most university modules.

We don’t want to have the maximum reward, because sometimes, the maximum reward takes too much effort.

Consider a generic task, which progress can be measured. That in itself is quite rare, because we are susceptible to changing the goalpost of completion. The first 70% takes a short time to finish, but the next 20% takes twice as long, and the next 5% takes even longer.

What we want practically is to maximise the reward-to-effort ratio. Start asking yourself: Where do I want to stop? Is more effort worth the benefit? How much does this feature improve the outcome? What does ‘done’ look like? Achieve that.

This is something I have adopted as a core operating principle. Am I being lazy? Maybe. At the end of the day, if I can achieve what is important to me, does it matter?

            "content": "This post is part 5 of a series of posts, discussing some lessons in my 3-week long exploration of Skillshare courses. . Background . For the past month, I have been writing about the lessons learnt from a Skillshare subscription I took in the past month. This post would be a meta-reflection on what I have learnt from them. . If you are interested, the other posts can be found here. . An introductory post | Skillshare Chapter 1: Productivity with Ali Abdaal | Skillshare Chapter 2: Productivity with Thomas Frank | Skillshare Chapter 3: Essentialism with Greg McKeown | The inspiration of this writing experiment was this blog post by fast.ai co-founder Rachel Thomas, who advocated blogging for the sake of learning and helping the people one step behind us. . This is a reminder that I should not restrict my learning to the professional life, and to continue growing in other domains as well. . Lesson 1: Drop things quickly . There is an endless volume of content available via Google, whether there are in text, or in video. If attention is not captured, move on to the others . Many courses were paused at an early stage. It wasn’t because of the course quality. The problem laid with the timing. I discovered the ideas at the wrong timing, when I did not know how to apply the ideas. . Lesson 2: Learning may not be unless you have created something out of it . I find I internalised the lessons deepest when I applied the lessons immediately into a project I was working on. . Examples of what can be created: . Writing a program after learning a programming language | Writing a journal entry or blog post to reflect on a learning experience | Practising a technique shown in a tutorial | . Considerations for future writing . This series of posts was a fruitful experiment in the articulating my ideas and putting them in prose. Some of my ideas have also been developed over the course of drafting and editing. . In continuing this process, I may choose one of the following to explore. . Consolidating my book notes: In the spirit of creation to consolidate my thinking. | Evergreen ideas: Exploring some core ideas that have been relevant to me for a few years. | Curation of resources: Sharing resources showing a 360 degree view of a big idea | Let me know what you think in the comments. .",

            "title": "Skillshare Chapter 3: Essentialism with Greg McKeown",
            "content": "This is going to be my last course review for a while, since it is the final week of the June holidays. While I return to work, I am going to examine my routines to see how I can continue this writing habit. . Who is the creator? . Greg McKeown is the author of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller, Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less. He advocates us to challenge our definitions of success, and work toward maximising its key levers. . Resources . His Skillshare class | His book: Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less | His personal website | How did this change my life? . This led me to streamline my journaling process, which I have stopped for a while now. I have deliberately set it up in Notion so I can access my journal from the pages I most frequently enter. | . Lesson 1: Only a few things really matter, and it is our responsibility to decide what they are . We need to have agency in what we prioritise. This means that we choose to invest the majority of our time and energy into pursuits that we select. It’s not possible to get everything we want done, so we need to decide which. . ….it’s clear in hindsight that I made a fool’s bargain, that I violated something more important for something less important, and what I learned with the simplest of lessons, which is this, if you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. . This means taking sure to allocate time for the big rocks such as personal health and family. The blurred boundaries in a remote work setting can mislead us into spending all our time at work. . Lesson 2: Say yes slowly, and say no very fast, because what ever we say ‘yes’ takes away time and energy from what is essential to us. . We typically agree very quickly to what people ask of us, and deny ourselves of what satisfies us. We need to flip that order, and instead pause before committing to any new projects. . ….as soon as you realize you can’t do it all, you realize you’re making trade-offs every day, every decision you make, every time you say yes, you’re saying no to something else. . Something we already know, is we have only limited time and energy in the day. If we have deliberately chosen what to focus, picking up new issues to put on our plate means we need to take something off the plate. . Examples of this in action: . Thinking carefully about potential projects and thinking what to give up to adopt them. | Taking time to consider with “Let me check my calendar, and I will get back to you.” | . Lesson 3: Make the essential easier by building routines and systems . How we become truly effective is through performing it consistently. To develop the consistency, we need some deliberate thinking to routinise our essential habits, removing the activation energy from taking action. . The idea is to do it consistently. The consistency is where the power is, because you just do a little bit until it becomes habitual, and so then you can keep on doing it for years and years. . Examples where this is implemented: . Jerry Seinfeld’s calendar, where he put a cross on every day he completed his writing task. Not continuing the habit then breaks the chain. | Starting habits small to build their consistency of execution. e.g. journalling one sentence a day, doing one push-up every time a trigger occurs. | .",

            "content": "This post is part 3 of a series of posts, discussing some lessons in my 3-week long exploration of Skillshare courses. The summary of the lessons learnt can be found here. . This Skillshare course, Productivity for Creatives: Build a System that Brings Out Your Best, is the second subject in my series of course summaries. It focuses on the building of systems, that we can rely on to produce quality work. . Who is the creator? | Why did I start following him? | Resources | Lesson 1: Take on the identity of a professional | Lesson 2: Leverage on external drivers to motivate yourself | Lesson 3: Creating a box to think within | How did this change my life? | Who is the creator? . Thomas Frank is a blogger and YouTuber who creates content on student-centric productivity, via his website College Info Geek. Nowadays, he also produces content on productivity in general, including tips on how to be competitive in our careers and personal finance. . Why did I start following him? . I was a productivity junkie in university, and College Info Geek was one of the websites I chanced upon. I liked that it offered a well-rounded view of the different aspects of student life, and Thomas Frank offered guidance on exceling in these different aspects. . Resources . The Skillshare course | His personal website, College Info Geek | His YouTube channel | Lesson 1: Take on the identity of a professional . Before we take creative actions, we must first believe ourselves to be a professional. That means to have the discipline in doing the work, and not waiting for inspiration to strike. That also means to work deliberately on improving our craft, so that we deliver quality content. . Professionals realized that when their craft is something they take seriously, when they adhere to a strict schedule and they work with discipline, inspiration tends to strike more often, you almost prime your mind for it. . Examples: . Schedule when to work on projects, whether they are from work or my own personal pursuits | Work on removing friction from your systems. Be obsessive about culling the inefficient parts from your workflow, and enhancing what works. | Use equipment that can allow you to do your tasks with reduced friction, even if it takes money to do so. The time and energy saved will be worth it. | . You’re going to find that when you get an idea, your default reaction to that idea isn’t, “That’s such a pain.” It’s, “No, let’s go ahead and do it because I know there’s not a bunch of friction, stress, and roadblocks in my way.” . Lesson 2: Leverage on external drivers to motivate yourself . Our motivation and drive are limited, and sometimes we have other commitments to others that we need to fulfill. Let these people keep us accountable. This allows us to save energy for our own creative projects. . The obligations we have, the bosses, the accountability partners, these people and these systems can push us to do things that we might not otherwise do if we’re just purely relying on self-discipline. . Examples: . Setting up a meeting with my project adviser once a week, to ensure that I keep up my readings and report writing consistently. | Working on side projects in the morning. This allows to put our freshest and most productive hours into the project, while relying on our bosses and colleagues to keep us accountable in getting our work done. | . Lesson 3: Creating a box to think within . If we are completely free in creating or producing something, we are often paralysed by the sheer amount of the options we have. We usually solve that by imposing some form of constraint, and somehow this allows us to make decisions much more easily to make progress. . …we often find that there’s just too much freedom, too many directions in which we could go, and either we end up not doing anything at all, or in my case, with too much freedom, I often end up making something that’s a bit bloated, not as tight as it could be. . Examples: . Parkinson’s law. Work expands to fill the time allotted to it. We can enhance our efficiency by setting our own deadlines, motivating us to figure it out. | Writing cheat sheets in university. As a major in Applied Mathematics, we were allowed to take in a single page of our own notes. It forces you to distill what is truly important to capture in this cheat sheet. | The character limit of each tweet forces writers to make their points sharp and concise. | . How did this change my life? . Adopting the professional mindset in what we want to do well in. | Focusing my motivation and discipline on the tasks I am driving myself in, and using external drivers to get the rest done. | Working on my Notion workspace to reduce friction in capturing notes. | .",

            "content": "This post is part 2 of a series of posts, discussing some lessons in my 3-week long exploration of Skillshare courses. The summary of the lessons learnt can be found here. . Ali Abdaal is a YouTuber who creates content to ‘help people lead happier, healthier and more productive lives with the overall aim of helping people do more of what matters to them.’ He is a medical doctor who has during the course of his studying and work, built a YouTube channel of over 1.5 million subscribers, created a series of online channels, and writes a weekly email newsletter and a blog. . He is the most recent productivity content creator I have followed, and I have been extremely impressed with his ability to manage and succeed at so many pursuits, including managing his career as a medical doctor, and running his multiple businesses. I adopted some of his practices, which led to an improvement of my management of studying, volunteering and professional work. . His course Productivity for Creators - Starting a Successful Side-Hustle has a rather self-explanatory title. It focuses on tactics to get one started on their side hustle, and where to find the time to work on it. Following are 3 of my greatest takeaways from the course. . Lesson 1: Do what you want by managing friction | Lesson 2: Be mindful in your downtime | Lesson 3: Change your identity to act | How this course changed me | Resources | Lesson 1: Do what you want by managing friction . “…anything that we can do to reduce the friction of doing stuff is going to massively improve our own productivity.” . In everything we do, there is some “activation energy” to perform that task, and to continue. This can apply to both good and bad habits we may be trying to build or kick. The idea here is to reduce the activation energy of the good habits we want to continue. On the flip side, we can increase the friction of bad habits we are trying to kick. . Some examples where friction can apply are: . Accessing social media only on your laptop or desktop, so that we can’t access it on our phones whenever we have a spare bit of attention. | Having your needed apps and programs set up with shortcuts so they are easy to access. | Having your exercise clothes and equipment laid out, so that going for a workout is easier. | . Lesson 2: Be mindful in your downtime . …if there’s nothing to do, I would sit on the computer at work or I would sit on my phone and I will just plan out video ideas, or write scripts for my videos, or write blog posts because those were the side projects I was working on at the time. It’s really about intentionally using that downtime. . What is a productivity course without the idea of using your free time productively. The main idea here is about consciously recognising that we have these pockets of free time. “I have no time” ceases to be a credible reason for why we are not engaging in what we want. . Some examples of how I have applied this: . Listening to podcasts and watching videos during downtime. | Having a specific Notion page set up on my phone, so that I can quickly jot down ideas. | . Notion is an upcoming note-taking app that I use to manage my personal task tracking and ideas. It has immense flexibility in how content can be organised. . Lesson 3: Change your identity to act . The most foreign idea to me is the concept of adopting an identity, to fit what we are pursuing. We then act to stay consistent with the identity we have adopted. . ….when I was learning how to code, when I was doing web design as a side hustle, it was initially hard for me to get this identity that I am a Web Designer, I am a Developer. But as soon as I adopted that identity, then suddenly my learning accelerated and I was able to actually make money from the thing because then I felt okay with offering my web design services on freelance websites. . I am currently working on applying this idea, since it appears to be a longer-term impact strategy. . How this course changed me . I started time blocking (which is another strategy found in the course) again, to start progress towards some large projects at work. | I am working towards more conscious decision making on how I spend my time and energy. | It made me start this website. | .

I have about two weeks of protected time, where I choose to spend it upgrading myself. I chanced upon Skillshare on the recommendation of some of my favourite YouTubers. . About taking online courses . Starting on this journey, I am not quite certain to the efficacy of taking courses online. Doing online courses via Udemy is something I have done to limited effect, in order to upgrade my programming skills. I have also spent a fair amount of time on Coursera (attending the excellent MOOC Learning How to Learn) and Khan Academy (which saved my Linear Algebra course grade in NUS, but these significant changes were limited in number. .

For starters, I wanted this video to replace the teacher’s explanation in the classroom, in hopes of scaling high-quality explanations for my classrooms in the years to come. . . I couldn’t achieve that pedagogical intention, because the video explanation is not that high-quality in the first place. Among some reasons I can think of are: . Lacking an audio explanation (a la Khan Academy) | Scenes moving too fast to allow students to consider the pedagogical intention of the videos. | .
